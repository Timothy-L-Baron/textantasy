# Textantasy
An original text-based fantasy game. I am creating it without looking at code for other games.

It is currently in progress and can partially be played from main2.

Copy all the files into the same folder and run from 'main2'.

The 'quick asset download' is a copy of all the files in a separate folder (if desired).
